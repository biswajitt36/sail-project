          <li><center>To bring out Data Democratization
            <img src="images/Data Democratisation .png" alt="data-democratisation"></center>
          <p>Data democratization means that everybody has access to data and there are no gatekeepers that create a bottleneck at the gateway to the data. It requires that we accompany the access with an easy way for people to understand the data so that they can use it to expedite decision-making and uncover opportunities for an organization. The goal is to have anybody use data at any time to make decisions with no barriers to access or understanding</p>
        <p>An organization that truly wants to democratize data needs to embrace the following principles (referred to as the trifecta of data democratization throughout this guide):
          
          <p>Empower employees to feel comfortable asking data-related questions</p>
          <p>Provide the right tools to enable everybody to work with data</p>
          <p>Perceive democratization of data as an ongoing process which might even require an organization-wide cultural shift</p>
          </p></li>
